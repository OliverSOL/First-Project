# First Project
Guided project with Dataquest

Background: 
We are newly hired data analysts for Fun Apps Inc, a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. Given that their apps are completely free to use, their source of revenue consists of in-app ads. The more users that see and interact with the ads, the larger the revenue for Fun Apps Inc. 
As our first project for Fun Apps Inc, we are tasked with analyzing which types of apps are more likely to attract more users to ensure greater revenue for our company.
